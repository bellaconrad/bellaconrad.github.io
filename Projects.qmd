In the Spring of 2025 I took a class Quantitative Reasoning class based in R. I wrote some code, and did some cool data science. Here is a collection of links!

## [My Spring 2025 Work](https://github.com/bellaconrad)

\- In this assignment we built a static users site with Github Pages

\- Includes a github repo for access to all the code.

\- Look at how high quality my work is!

Here are some of the labs I worked on in this class as well!

Lab 1: I learned how to create a website and reinforced the skill of creating a yml header. Here is my yml header!

Lab 2: In this lab, I learned how to use the slice function and mutate function. I got a lot of practice doing this throughout the lab. I also learned how to create a code chunk and pipe my code to make for longer work. Here is a code chunk where I use all of these skills

Lab 3: In Lab 3, I learned a lot, but my biggest takeaway was learning how to put different graphs in one image. I have an example of this below!

Lab 4: In Lab 4, I learned how to run many statistical tests to determine the statistical significance of a hypothesis. Here is an example of when I ran an equal variance test and determined that we would reject the null hypothesis.

Lab 5: In this lab, we started researching our final project proposals. As I was the main author for this paper, I got very involved with linking citations and using BibTex. This was very interesting and it was great to see how simple R can make putting citations into a manuscript. I have included a picture of what our references look like in the code.

Lab 6: This lab was very helpful to learn how to split data, create a recipe, bake it, and then analyze which model is best for looking at this data. Creating a workflow set out of this helps to do that. I have included a picture of this process along with the ranking of the models and my decision on which model was the best.

Lab 7: In Lab 7, we worked further on our final project. In this we created our Intro and methods draft. We worked on EDA and cleaning our datasets in both Excel and in R. Here is some of what we worked on in R!

Lab 8: In this lab, we built on our previous work from lab 6 and expanded it. We worked on finding a model that fit the dataset the best, but then also tuned these models. This proved to be very challenging for me, so there was a lot of troubleshooting involved, but eventually I got there. Here is an image of the successful model tuning I did with a linear model.

Lab 9: For this lab, we worked on the results and discussion draft for our final project. In this draft, I learned how to fork and pull a peer's repo then edit it and push it so they could save my changes. This was very insightful and helped for the processes during our final project. You can see where I initially edited it in the picture below where it says "Bella test".

Lab 10: This lab was a new, and harder concept to me. We focused on plotting data onto maps of the US. I have included a picture of the code that I used and the output of it, which is a map.

Lab 11: For this lab, we presented a lightning talk with our findings. We researched the topic Urbanization, Density, and Access to Public Parks in the US. Our research question was "How do urban population demographics impact access to open space in the US" and we hypothesized that there is an intermediate relationship between population density and public open space access. I included a picture of our methods slides below, to show how we researched and analyzed this topic. Overall, we rejected our null hypothesis, coming to the conclusion that we would need more, and possibly better data if we wanted to research this again.
