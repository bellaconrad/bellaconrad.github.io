In the Spring of 2025 I took a class Quantitative Reasoning class based in R. I wrote some code, and did some cool data science. Here is a collection of links!

## [My Spring 2025 Work](https://github.com/bellaconrad)

\- In this assignment we built a static users site with Github Pages

\- Includes a github repo for access to all the code.

\- Look at how high quality my work is!

Here are some of the labs I worked on in this class as well!

Lab 1: I learned how to create a website and reinforced the skill of creating a yml header. Here is my yml header!

Lab 2: In this lab, I learned how to use the slice function and mutate function. I got a lot of practice doing this throughout the lab. I also learned how to create a code chunk and pipe my code to make for longer work. Here is a code chunk where I use all of these skills

Lab 3: In Lab 3, I learned a lot, but my biggest takeaway was learning how to put different graphs in one image. I have an example of this below!

Lab 4: In Lab 4, I learned how to run many statistical tests to determine the statistical significance of a hypothesis. Here is an example of when I ran an equal variance test and determined that we would reject the null hypothesis.
