Here is my yml header!\n\nLab 2: In this lab, I learned how to use the slice function and mutate function. I got a lot of practice doing this throughout the lab. I also learned how to create a code chunk and pipe my code to make for longer work. Here is a code chunk where I use all of these skills\n\nLab 3: In Lab 3, I learned a lot, but my biggest takeaway was learning how to put different graphs in one image. I have an example of this below!\n\nLab 4: In Lab 4, I learned how to run many statistical tests to determine the statistical significance of a hypothesis. Here is an example of when I ran an equal variance test and determined that we would reject the null hypothesis.\n\nLab 5:"
